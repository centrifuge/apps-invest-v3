### Required Secrets

#### Repository Secrets (for dev/demo)
```bash
gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN --body "your-api-token"
gh variable set CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID --body "your-account-id"
```

#### Production Environment Secrets
```bash
# As of now, GitHub CLI does not natively support creating environments via a simple command,
# and the REST API for environments is only available for GitHub Enterprise Server.
# For public GitHub.com repositories, you must create environments manually in the repository settings UI.
# See: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/25220

# 1. Go to your repository â†’ Settings â†’ Environments â†’ New environment, and create "production" there.


# 2. Upload secrets to production environment
gh secret set CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN --env production --body "your-api-token"
gh variable set CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID --env production --body "your-account-id"
```
